//Interview questions
Types of variables==3 types==Local Instance and Static

Local Variables==
declared inside the block of code.

---pros--
occupy memory for shortest time
--cons---
can't be accessed outside of that block in which its written.

Instance variables==

    Are the variable that are declared inside a class but outside the block of code.

--upside:
    can be accessed in all the method of the class.
    can have different values for that class.

Static Variables==

    All variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword.

    --upside:
        reserve single memory location for all instance
        can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name

        -----downside:
        Occupy the memory for longest period of time.

Real life use:

    most of the time constant values in static variables.
    Static is also used heavily with methods that dont involve instance variable.


Access Modifiers;

    There are 3 access modifier keywords(private protected public) and
    four access levels in java.
   ---------- can only be used with instance and static members-----------

   members=====the fields and the methods of a class

Private:
    -only accessible in that method or variable in that class.

Real Life Use:
    --99% of instance field are always private.

 Default(it is not a keyword):

 -we can access that member inside the same class inside the same package
 in other classes.

 Public:

 --when we use the public access modifiers, available through out the project.
 real life use:
     99% of the time instance fields are private.
     99% of the time instance and static methods are public.
