what Method Overloading in Java.
    with the help of method overloading we can have many methods with same name but
    different parameters in a class.
Why we should use MethodOverloading.
    1) Cleaner code if multiple methods are doing the same thing we don't need to come
    up with different names.
    2) Flexibility for the end user.
How we can use MethodOverloading in java.
    we can overload a method by changing three things
    1) Number of parameters
    2) change the data type of parameters
    3) we can change the sequence of parameters.
class Calculator{

int sum(int num1,int num2){
return num1+num2;
}

int sum(int num1,int num2,int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}

double sum(double num1,int num2,int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}

}

Rules:
    1) Method names should be same but parameters should be different.
    2) we can't overload a method by just changing its return type.
    3) We can also overload constructors by following the same rules.
=========================================================================
what is MethodOverriding:
        Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class

Why we should override a method:
        If we are inheriting from a parent class and we don't like
        the implementation of a method from the parent class we can provide
        our own implementation.Sometimes it is done to improve the performance fo code.



How we can override a method:
    when we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside the child class.
    all should be same except the body and access modifiers.

Rules:

1)for override we must inherit from a class.
2) The method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same
as method in the child class only the access modifiers can be different.
3)the access modifiers in the parent class can only be increased with the respect
to the visibility for example we can change default to protected or to public but we cant make
it private.

4) if something is not inherited we cant override it
for example private method and constructors
