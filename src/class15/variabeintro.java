    // 3 types of variable
    /*

    local,
    inside a method or a part of its parameter or a loop or a swtich

     instance,
      if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
      switch statement
      static
    if an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called a static
    variable

    Why learn about different types of variables:


    1) it helps us reduce the amount of RAM
    2)With the help of these variables we can pass the information  between the methods of classes
    3) local occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as your method is done
    excecuting they are destroyed by a special program calls grabage collector.

    How to uses these:

    Local: create inside the block of code.

    Pros vs cons

    Local variables;

Pros:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time always try to use local
    variables when possible
cons:
    THEY are very limited in the scope means we cant access them outside of method or that block
    of code.


Instance variables:

they are created inside the class but outside a block of code.


Pros:
They have broader scope as compared to the local variables means we can access in all the method of that class
but not in static word

Cons:
Takes space in RAM for Longer period  time.

Static variable:
if we have a instance variable with a static keyword then it is called static variable

Pros:

highest scope.availble accross the object of the class.
can be called without creating the object of that class
We can shre a single value between all the objects of a class
cons:
