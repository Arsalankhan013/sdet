Access modifiers:


Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of classes, variables, methods and other code of
block.there are four access level in java private default(it is not a keyword) protected and public. we have three
keywords that define thses access levels 1) Private 2) Protected 3) Public.

Private:

When we use the private keyword with a method or a field it is only accessible inside that class.it is
the most restricted access modifier.

Default(it is not a keyword):

When we dont use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default access is applied by java which
means we can access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other classes which exists inside the
same package.

Protected:
we access that method or variable







When we use the public access modifier ew can use that field or method anywhere inside the same project.
