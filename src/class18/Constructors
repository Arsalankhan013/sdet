What is a Constructors in Java:

    A constructor is a special block of code that help us give initial values to the fields
    of a class.initialization of object or instance.

Whe we should use a Constructor.
    1)
    When we use the constructors to initialize the object it looks more readable and cleaner.
    2)
    if the fields of the class are private its not possible to access them outside a class
    without constructor or a method which means we cant initialize them without a method or
    a constructor.
    3)
     we can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables with help
    of a constructor.
    4)
    if we want to make sure that some lines of the code should always be executed when the
    object of a class is created we can put that code inside the constructor.

How to use Constructor.

    We create constructors inside the class and when an object of that class is created
    the constructor is executed automatically.

    Class Car{
    String make;
    String model;

    Car(String carMake, String carModel){
    make=carMake;
    model=carModel;

    }
    Public static void main(String [] args){
    Car bmw=new Car(): // CAR() calls to the constructor
   }
    }

 Rules:
      1) Constructors don't have return types not even void.

      2) The name of the constructor should always be same as name of the class.

      3) Constructors cant be created with a static keyword. becauase it needs to initialize values.

      4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructors.like Private,Public and Static.

      5) If we don't create a constructor in a class a default constructor with zero
      parameters is created by compiler().compiler==takes the code written by us and convert code to bite code
      which is easier for java to understand.

      6) We can create a multipe constructor to give the other users flexibility that they
      dont have to provide all the values to all the instance fields when craeting an object
      of our class.

      7) we can call the constructor of a class by using this keyword with parenthesis


this keyword:
   - We can use "this" keyword to access the instance variables when you have same name
    variables in your method or constructor or any block of code.

this();
        Calls the constructors of a class inside other constructors.
        help us reuse the already used constructors containing same code
        prefer to create multiple constructors on the first place because it ll give user flexibility so he can
        create the objects in many ways
